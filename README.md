# Hate-Crime-Prediction
The primary goal of this study is to predict the number of hate crime per 100,000 in each state. 
To achieve this goal, firstly, I understand and explore the data (including outlier, influential data, leverage point and multicollinearity), and conduct a general OLS regression analysis to test linearity and other regression assumptions. 
Then I adopt four variable selection methods to select import independent variables and the best model. 
Finally, I test the assumptions of the best regression model and use it to predict the number of hate crime in Hawaii.
